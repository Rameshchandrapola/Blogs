## Hello everyone! üß°

Before we start Let‚Äôs stay connected.
[GitHub](https://github.com/Rameshchandrapola)‚≠ê[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rameshchandrapola/) and also follow me here for more useful blogs.

In this article, we will learn **what gradients are and also types of CSS gradients**.
## Let's get startedü§©

### What is a gradient?

Gradients are CSS elements of the image data type that show a transition between two or more colours. Gradients are very much important as they give good UX to the users. The most popular use for gradients would be in a background element. Backgrounds have a massive impact on a website‚Äôs design. So I hope this blog will help you to make beautiful coloured gradients.
> The term background-image refers specifically to gradients. Because gradients have a stacking order, you can think of them as layered background images

### Types of Gradients ‚ú®
There are three types of gradient functions in CSS: 
1. **Linear-Gradient** (created with the linear-gradient() function)
1. **Radial-Gradient **(created with the radial-gradient() function) 
1. **Conic-Gradient** (created with the conic-gradient() function).


## Linear Gradient

- A linear gradient creates a band of colours that progress in a straight line.
- A linear gradient is made up of two basic components: direction and color-stops.
- To create a gradient, You must have at least two colors, but you can have as many as you want.

### 1. Direction

```
// Default direction will be from top-bottom if no direction is given 
  background-image: linear-gradient( #fc00ff, #00dbde);
// From left to right
  background-image: linear-gradient( to right, #fc00ff, #00dbde);
```

In the same way, we can change their rotation by specifying a direction.

```
// Diagonally, From corner to corner
background-image: linear-gradient( to bottom right, #fc00ff, #00dbde);
// Specific angle
background-image: linear-gradient( 70deg , #fc00ff, #00dbde);
```

### 2. Color stops 

- Color stops define what colors make up the gradient and optionally, where to put them.
- If you specify the location as a percentage, 0% represents the starting point, while 100% represents the ending point

```
  background-image: linear-gradient(#eb622c ,#fc00ff 70%, #00dbde);
```

## Radial Gradient
- Radial gradients are similar to linear gradients, except that they radiate out from a central point

```
// Simple Radial-gradient
  background-image: radial-gradient(#1CD8D2,#ff77cd);
// Radial color stops
  background-image: radial-gradient(#1CD8D2 12px,#ED4264 30%,#7474BF 60%);
```

## Conic Gradient
- Creates an image consisting of a gradient with color transitions rotated around a center point.
```
// Simple Conic Gradient
  background: conic-gradient( #EECDA3, #EF629F);
// Positioning the conic center
  background: conic-gradient(at 10% 30%, #fffb00 20%, #e246cd 30%, #27f1f1 40%);
```
